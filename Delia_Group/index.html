			<h3>Joining The Delia Group was one of the best decisions I could have made. I can honestly say that being a part of this team, is like being a part of a family.

			<h3>I have known Joe and Renee practically my whole life. A few years ago, they we were at a wedding and Joe told me his plans to come back to Michigan and build this real estate business. Not only did Joe and Renee do what they said they were going to do they went up and beyond everything they said they were going to do. Fast forward to the end of 2015 I get a call from Joe and he says he needs someone to come work for him that he can trust and will work hard and he knew I was the guy to call. Joe and Renee have since given me the opportunity to make all my goals and dreams come true all while working hard with an amazing company and group of people.<br><i>-Justin Delk, Real Estate Agent</i></h3>
