            <h1>Everyone has their own image of a strong and healthy person.
            And it is an individuate image because all people have different backgrounds and history.

            But we all imagine an disciplined and lively mind under the surface of this strong and healthy person.
            This means that not only the body is the goal but the mind of such an ideal person.
            Lucy Method is grounded on experience of modern people and research papers dealt with first people.
            It embraces the lifestyle of homo sapience of the period nor less then 3.2 million years.
            That is the age of Lucy.

            Lucy is a collection of fossilized bones which were discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The bones made up a
            skeleton of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. The assembly is also known as Dinkinesh,
            which means “you are marvelous” in the Amharic language.

            Lucy Method combines physical exercises and otherworldliness
            editations.
            Moreover combined with knowledge of nutrition and living.

            As Lucy was the first hominid the main idea of the method is “back to the movement”.

            The method proves that people should look back through million of years and become opportunistic
            movers again.  It should be done for many reasons and the main one is to heal your body.
            Our locomotion is tough and it doesn’t give us the opportunity to expand freedom of movement in
            our ordinary habitual life.

            Any movement brings life and energy.
            Any limitation causes health problems.
            Any exploration brings changes.

            Lucy Method combines all the possible ways of expressing freedom of our body.
            The method been elaborated with as much simplicity of prehistoric experience as possible.
            We should be ready to admit that people are a part of evolution

            We should be ready to explore all the possibilities to become natural, to get to know where we came from and evolve a part of  every animal living on Earth in ourselves.
            Not only to our body but also to our mind.  We are talking about that enormous colossal paradigm shift which we were born with and is present in our deep neurological system.

            Modern scientific research shows that physical exercise influences the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems.
            There is a possibility that the interactions between brain neurotransmitters and their specific receptors could play a role in the onset
            of fatigue during prolonged exercise. This proves again that any movement brings changes to our body and mind. We should try to get
            back to the first people, to Lucy  and find that unique style of moving that is lost now.
            To live a strong, healthy and pain free existence.

            You have always been.</h1>
