            <b>The ideal urban human</b><br>
            Everyone has their own image of a strong and healthy person.<br>
            And it is an individuate image because all people have different backgrounds and history.<br>
            But we all imagine a disciplined and lively mind under the surface of this strong and healthy person.<br>
            This means that not only the body is the goal but the mind of such an ideal person. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>History</b><br>
            Lucy Method is grounded on experience of modern people and research papers dealt with the first people. <br>
            It embraces the lifestyle of homo sapience of the period nor less then 3.2 million years. <br>
            That is the age of Lucy. <br>
            Lucy is a collection of fossilized bones which were discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. <br>
            The bones made up a skeleton of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. <br>
            The assembly is also known as Dinkinesh, which means “you are marvelous” in the Amharic language.<br>
            The method has been elaborated with as much simplicity of prehistoric experience as possible. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Back to the movement</b><br>
            Lucy Method combines physical exercises and otherworldliness<br>
            editations. <br>
            Moreover combined with knowledge of nutrition and living. <br>
            As Lucy was the first hominid the main idea of the method is “back to the movement”. <br>
            The method proves that people should look back through millions of years and become opportunistic movers again. <br>
            It should be done for many reasons and the main one is to heal our bodies.<br>
            Our locomotion is tough and it doesn’t give us the opportunity to expand freedom of movement in our ordinary habitual life.<br>
            Lucy Method combines all the possible ways of expressing freedom of our body, where limitation are causing health problems.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>You have always been</b><br>
            We should be ready to admit that people are a part of evolution.<br>
            We should be ready to explore all the possibilities to become natural, to get to know where we came from and evolve a part of every animal living on Earth in ourselves.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only to our body but also to our mind.<br>
            We are talking about that enormous colossal paradigm shift which we were born with and is present in our deep neurological system.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern scientific research shows that physical exercise influences the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic systems and your entire mitochondria.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The interactions between neurotransmitters and their specific receptors are playing a major role in the onset of fatigue during prolonged exercise.<br>
            This proves that any movement brings life and energy to our body and mind. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we should get back to the first people, to Lucy and find that unique style of moving that is lost now and make it once again our own.<br>
            The key to live a strong, healthy and pain free existence. <br>
