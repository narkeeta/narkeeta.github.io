				<h1>Jeany Ngo's Portfolio Site</h1>
				<p>For this project I was tasked with making a custom portfolio site for my client. I coded it as a custom Wordpress theme so that she would be able to easily add new work to the site in the future. I was given designs for the full screen version of the site. I took her designs and went to work translating it to PHP, CSS, and Javascript. Once I had the site made, I went in and added custom animations to the pages, using css keyframes and jascript. You can find the site live at: <a href="http://www.jeanyngo.com/">www.jeanyngo.com</a></p>

				<h1>Sugar Website</h1>
				<p>My client for this project provided me a few PSD designs for their new website. I coded the site as a custom wordpress theme, using advanced custom fields as the only main plugin. I made everything modular so that they could add and edit the pages easily once I was finsihed coding the theme. The site was focused on being minimalist so I simply added a few fade in animations to some of the pages elements to give it a little extra flare.

				<h1>FreshRent Redesign</h1>
				<p>For this project I did a full redesign of Freshrent's website design. The site was originally built with a pre-made theme, and I wen't in and added custom elements and designs to the site, including custom property pages. I also created a front end interface for their clients to use to update info on the site, and connected everything up with their CRM. In all I made around 10 custom page templates for the site and redesigned the rest. Sadly the client hasn't kept up with maintenance on the site, and now a few pages are unfunctional, however you can find still find it at: <a href="https://freshrent.co.uk">freshrent.co.uk</a></p>
