				<h1>Visit Ventura</h1>
				<p>For this project I worked with my team to redesign Visit Ventura's website. Starting from the ground up I worked with a designer and content writer to re-imagine their website and give it a more modern, engaging look and feel, aiming to increase user engagement based on their target markets.</p>
				<p>The site is built with a modern wordpress theme, with the majority of the site built with custom Gutenberg blocks and core blocks styled to fit the new look. As the lead developer and project manager, I was responsible for coding the entirety of the site, as well as helping manage the team as we worked though the redesign, keeping the project on pace over the six month timeline we had.

				<h1>Visit Buffalo Niagara</h1>
				<p>For this client, I've worked developing and managing their website for over three years, where with a team of various designers and content writers we worked in two week agile sprints, improving various aspects of the website over time. Over the last three years, we've redesigned the majority of the website, including creating highly customized pages related to various campaigns depending on when they were running.</p>
				<p>Most recently we've begun the process of re-imagining their brand's style, and giving the site an updated style guide and look, as well as transitioning the site's theme to utilize the Gutenberg editor rather than custom templates. Starting with an updated homepage, we focused more heavily on UI/UX, engaging animations, and engaging visuals utilizing their media assets.

				<h1>Visit Mammoth</h1>
				<p>In this project, rather than building a brand new website we were tasked with recreating their website in WordPress, moving it away from Drupal. Over the course of six months I worked on various custom scripts written in PHP to convert the previous sites database into a WordPress installation, as well as re-purposing their Drupal theme into a WordPress theme to match all existing styles and architecture.

				<h1>Visit Fairfield</h1>
				<p>For this client we have worked with them for over two years, working in 2 week agile sprints to continuously update their site's theme, after initially converting their website from a proprietary CMS into WordPress. Along with the initial build and continuous work, we developed a custom plugin in order to pull in their CRM's listings and events through an API that synced the information with a nightly cron job.
