				<h1>Visit Ventura</h1>
				<p>For this project I worked with my team to redesign Visit Ventura's website. Starting from the ground up I worked with a designer and content writer to re-imagine their website and give it a more modern, engaging look and feel, aiming to increase user engagement based on their target markets.</p>
				<p>The site is build with a modern wordpress theme, with the majority of the site built with custom Gutenberg blocks and core blocks styled to fit the new look. As the lead developer and project manager, I was responsible for coding the entirety of the site, as well as helping manage the team as we worked though the redesign, keeping the project on pace over the six month timeline we had.

				<h1>Visit Buffalo Niagara</h1>
				<p>For this client, I've worked developing and managing their website for over three years, where with a team of various designers and content writers we worked in two week sprints, improving various aspects of the website over time. Over the last three years, we've redesigned the majority of the website, including creating highly customized pages related to various campaigns depending on when they were running.</p>
				<p>Most recently we've begun the process of re-imagining their brand's style, and giving the site an updated styleguide. Starting with an updated homepage, focusing more heavily on UI/UX, engaging animations, and a focus on highlighting their media assets.

				<h1>Visit Mammoth</h1>
				<p>In this project, rather than building a brand new website we were tasked with recreating their website in WordPress, moving it away from Drupal. Over the course of six months I worked on various custom scripts to convert the privious sites database into a WordPress instalation, as well as re-purposing their Drupal theme into a WordPress theme to match all existing styles and architecture.

				<h1>Visit Fairfield</h1>
				<p>For this client we have worked with them for over two years, working in 2 week agile sprints to continuosly update their site's theme, after initially converting their website from a proprietary CMS into WordPress. Along with the initial build and continuous work, we developed a custom plugin in order to pull in their CRM's listings and events through an API that synced the information with a nightly cron job.

				<h1>FreshRent Redesign</h1>
				<p>For this project I did a full redesign of Freshrent's website design. The site was originally built with a pre-made theme, and I went in and added custom elements and designs to the site, including custom property pages. I also created a front end interface for their clients to use to update info on the site, and connected everything up with their CRM. In all I made around 10 custom page templates for the site and redesigned the rest. Sadly the client hasn't kept up with maintenance on the site, and now a few pages are nonfunctional, however you can find still find it at: <a href="https://freshrent.co.uk" target="_blank">freshrent.co.uk</a></p>
