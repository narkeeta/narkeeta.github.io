			<h2>About</h2>
			<h3>My name is Collin McCabe and I specalize in custom web development. I live in Tucson Arizona and work through the University of Arizona computer science program. I have over a year of experience in professional website design, working mostly throught UpWork. I code in html, css, javascript, and php to make beautiful websites and custom content management systems for my clients. I can also create custom wordpress templates. I'm always avalible for work so send me a message if you are interested in hiring me for a job.</h3>

			<div class="title-container">
				<h2>Pricing</h2>
				<h3>I charge around 50 dollars an hour for projects. However I work with fixed price contracts so I would rate a job based on how long I think it would take to complete them, and therefor any extra time needed to be spent on a project wouldn't be charged to a client. I generally make websites for 500-1500 dollars depending on the ammount of work involved with the websites.</h3>
