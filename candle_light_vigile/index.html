		<h3>The Cause</h3>
		<h4>Mounting evidence tells a terrible tale of murder and mutilation in China. Witnesses and Chinese physicians reveal that tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are being killed for their organs, which are sold and transplanted at enormous profit.</h4>
		<h4>“After months of investigation, including undercover interviews with doctors throughout 12 provinces in China, we come to the regrettable conclusion that these allegations are true.”</h4>
		<h5>—Hon. David Kilgour, JD, Former Canadian Secretary of State, Asia-Pacific</h5>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<h4>On June 22, 2016, David Matas and David Kilgour published an update to their previous report from 2006. <a href="">(Click Here to Learn More)</a> Organ harvesting first came to light in 2006, the updated report shows continued expansion of organ transplant capacity is ongoing. Driving factors behind the industry’s growth are the Communist Party, government agencies, and individual officials who implement and perpetuate the systematic killing of prisoners of conscience for their organs. Third parties estimate upwards of 900,000 to 1,500,000 peaceful Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs.</h4>
		
		<h3><br>What is Fallun Gong?</h3>
		<h4>Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong, is a self-practice system that combines ancient Chinese teachings with meditation exercises. The principal text, written by Falun Dafa founder Li Hongzhi, is Zhuan Falun. It teaches practitioners to live by three basic principles: Truthfulness (Zhen 真), Compassion (Shan 善), Forbearance (Ren 忍).<br><br>Falun Dafa has a heritage dating back thousands of years when it existed as teachings passed down secretly from one master to one disciple for generations. It was introduced to the public in 1992 when its founder, Li Hongzhi gave the first series of lectures on the practice in his hometown of Changchun, in northeastern China. The practice grew to having 70 - 100 Million practitioners by 1998.<br><br>On July 20, 1999, thousands were arrested and official persecution began. Massive arrests ensued along with the confiscation of Falun Gong-related materials. A nationwide propaganda campaign was launched in synch.<br><br>How could such a persecution come about? The then-Chinese Communist Party Chairman Jiang Zemin felt threatened by the sheer number of practitioners. Falun Dafa practitioners did not see their spiritual practice as being in conflict with the government, but Jiang saw them as a threat</h4>
