		<h3>The Cause</h3>
		<h4>Mounting evidence tells a terrible tale of murder and mutilation in China. Witnesses and Chinese physicians reveal that tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are being killed for their organs, which are sold and transplanted at enormous profit.</h4>
		<h4>“After months of investigation, including undercover interviews with doctors throughout 12 provinces in China, we come to the regrettable conclusion that these allegations are true.”</h4>
		<h5>—Hon. David Kilgour, JD, Former Canadian Secretary of State, Asia-Pacific</h5>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<h4>On June 22, 2016, David Matas and David Kilgour published an update to their previous report from 2006. <a href="">(Click Here to Learn More)</a> Organ harvesting first came to light in 2006, the updated report shows continued expansion of organ transplant capacity is ongoing. Driving factors behind the industry’s growth are the Communist Party, government agencies, and individual officials who implement and perpetuate the systematic killing of prisoners of conscience for their organs. Third parties estimate upwards of 900,000 to 1,500,000 peaceful Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs.</h4>
